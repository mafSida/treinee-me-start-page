# treinee-me-start-page

Responsive landing page built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and SVG.

## Overview
This project is a practice exercise based on a Figma Community mockup by a contributor from Figma Community, [Pio](https://www.figma.com/@pio). It focuses on creating a clean, responsive landing page with advanced CSS techniques, including layout management with Flexbox, smooth hover effects, and integration of SVG icons. The project also features user interaction through a button linking to a WhatsApp chat for ordering personalized workout plans.

The design mockup used for this project can be found [here]([https://www.figma.com/community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1214679726391393976/layout-to-study-html-css)).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**:
  - Structured the web page using semantic HTML elements (`header`, `section`, `footer`, etc.) for better accessibility and SEO.
  - Embedded SVG icons using an SVG sprite for better performance and scalability.

- **CSS3**:
  - Applied a responsive layout using **Flexbox** for efficient content alignment and space distribution across various screen sizes.
  - Used **transitions** for smooth hover effects on buttons and links.
  - Implemented **linear gradient** backgrounds for a modern and visually appealing look.
  - Customized button styles and hover states for improved user interaction.

- **SVG Icons**:
  - Integrated and optimized **SVG sprites** for icons, ensuring they are scalable, lightweight, and efficiently managed within a single file.

- **Google Fonts**:
  - Incorporated custom fonts from **Google Fonts** to enhance typography and maintain design consistency. The fonts used in this project include:
    - **DM Sans** for button text.
    - **Mulish** for general content.
    - **Inter** for the logo and headers.
    - **Open Sans** for the body text and additional content.

- **Modern Normalize**:
  - Implemented **Modern Normalize** to ensure cross-browser consistency by resetting default browser styles, providing a clean slate for custom styling.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Designed the layout to be fully responsive across various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) by using relative units (`%, vh, vw`) and media queries to adjust the layout and typography for smaller screens.
  - Ensured elements are flexible and adapt to screen sizes, maintaining readability and usability on all devices.

- **External Services Integration**:
  - Linked the "Start now" button to WhatsApp using the `wa.me` link format, allowing users to initiate a chat directly for ordering personalized workout plans. This adds a functional layer to the landing page and enhances user interaction.

## Summary
In this project, I have:
- Built a fully responsive landing page using semantic HTML and CSS3.
- Styled interactive elements like buttons with hover effects and transitions.
- Integrated and optimized SVG icons within a sprite for scalability and performance.
- Implemented external service integration with WhatsApp for user interaction.
